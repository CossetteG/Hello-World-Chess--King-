Upon Midnight thought I have concluded
That history can be summed up like this:
    1) The East has a political identity crisis
    2) The West is a greedy bitch
    3) Everyone else gets shit on
    4) Most places get a Golden Age at some point, but Islam's was the best and no one can convince me otherwise
