Dear Chess,
We side with pawns 
    because we too want to make it to the end of the board
    to gain a crown that allows us to move better
    and kill better
However
    we find it distasteful that you cannot stack on top of one another
    and move on every color like a heathen
So
    we will help you stage a coup
    and start a revolution
    and in the aftermath a new king will rise
    The Bishop
        the only one with enough sense to be selective about the color sqaures they step on
        the bishop will build a democracy onto the board
        and bring freedom to the pawns
Be prepared
Best Regards,
 Checkers
